# Miscellaneous Notes
- Git branching: name according to kind of branch/specifics. E.g. “feat/i18n”, “fix/my_bug”. For issues, mention the commit in the comments.
- Arnav volunteered to spearhead GitHub issues (e.g. minimize version conflicts).
- Stand-ups: every other day (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) – message in stand-up channel.

# New channels
- work-plan
- help

# New issue ideas
- User Documentation (add “How to Use” buttons on pages where that’s not already a button).
- Do runtime testing/messages for.
