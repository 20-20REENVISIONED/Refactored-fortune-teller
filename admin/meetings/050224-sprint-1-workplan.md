# Tasks for First Sprint

- [H] [2 hours] Transcribe features into GitHub issues
- [H — first step] [8 hours] Improve the documentation:
  - Open door in README (incl. class/code diagrams — tool: PlantUML)
  - File headers
  - CI/CD pipeline
- [H, Easy] [5 hours] Notify users with JavaScript off that the site will not work (Probably a `<noscript>` tag).
- [H] Ask Powell questions about unknowns like language translation
- [H/M] [3 hours] Fix the open cookie button is not visible on an iPhone SE3 if it's in landscape
  - May be a flexbox-related issue
- [M] [7.5 hours] {uncertainty: low} Make site installable as a Progressive Web App with offline access
- [M] [next sprint] [? hours] {uncertainty: high} Setup to allow the site to be translated into various languages (maybe CI/CD pipeline that spits out an "en" folder, "zh" folder by reading localization overrides for text, alternatively can be done locally in JavaScript with a JSON containing localizations)
- [M, ] [10 hours?] Fix the audio that does not work
  - Fortune-cookie reading; test whether voices work across different devices/OS
