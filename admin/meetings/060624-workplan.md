### üïú Backlog
- [L] Setup of a CI/CD pipeline that automatically flattens HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into one HTML file to reduce ping-ponging (latency). Maybe use something like [this](https://github.com/remy/inliner).
- [L/M] {uncertainty: high} Add a fortune-telling feature that uses ChatGPT to generate a response for the user & implement/configure a backend for managing ChatGPT calls [#8](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/8).
- [L] Fix poor practices in HTML (use of `<div>` over `<section>`, no usage of `<picture>`, just `<img>`, background PNG -> WEBPs, JPGs).
- [L] Fix poor CSS practices (use of literal values instead of `var`, usage of absolute units (px) in CSS instead of relative units (scaling problem), usage of `width` and `height` instead of `inline` and `block` or `left/right` and `top/bottom` instead of `inline-start/inline-end` and `block-start/block-end` (accessibility problem)) [#15](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/15).
- [L ‚Äî leave for later] Some text does not meet WCAG standards for accessible text.
- [M] Fix the audio that does not work [#6](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/6). Fortune-cookie reading; test whether voices work across different devices/OS.

### ‚û°Ô∏è In-Progress

### ‚úÖ Done
- [L] {uncertainty: high} Add the opening animation (CSS animation?) [#10](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/10).
- [H, Easy] Notify users with JavaScript off that the site will not work (Probably a `<noscript>` tag). [#2](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/2).
- [H] Add a setting that allows the user to change things [#11](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/11). {uncertainty: low}
  - Language change.
  - Change or disable/enable music.
  - Theme/color background (can match system light/dark mode system).
  - User feedback option (look into Google Analytics).
  - Reference user‚Äôs font settings/Increase font size.
- [L] Fix skip animation button is intermittently broken. Occurs when opening cookie several times (potentially asynchronous call issue; reproduce by adding timeout calls to experiment with different event ordering). Fix skipping animation in Fortune Cookie also means the text-to-speech is skipped.
- [M] {uncertainty: high} Setup to allow the site to be translated into various languages (maybe CI/CD pipeline that spits out an en folder, zh folder by reading localization overrides) [#7](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/7). Support the usage of different [writing-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode) for applicable languages.
- [L] Add some background music when we take some actions on the website [#9](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/9). {uncertainty: high} Could use voice recognition API (target music by age) and/or Suno (music generation).
- [L] {uncertainty: high} Add voiceover via text-to-speech for portions of the website.
- [L] Optimization [#7](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/7).
- [H ‚Äî first step] Improve the documentation: [#1](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/1). Open door in README (incl. class/code diagrams ‚Äî tool: PlantUML), file headers, CI/CD pipeline.
- [H/M] Fix the open cookie button not being visible on an iPhone SE3 if it's in landscape [#3](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/3). May be a flexbox-related issue.
- [M] {uncertainty: low} Make site installable as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) with offline access [#4](https://github.com/20-20REENVISIONED/Refactored-fortune-teller/issues/4).
